Forestry: Community Edition is a fork of the classic [Forestry](https://github.com/ForestryMC/ForestryMC) Minecraft mod,
known for its bees, trees, and automatic farms. This fork began after all of Forestry's maintainers eventually
went inactive after the 1.13+ flattening.

### Reporting Bugs
Please make sure the bug has not already been reported by [searching the issues](https://github.com/ForestryMC/ForestryMC/issues?q=is%3Aissue).

For crashes, you must post a link to the full crash report.  
[gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com) is a good place to upload them.  
Full crash reports are located in [the minecraft data folder](http://hopper.minecraft.net/help/finding-minecraft-data-folder/), in "crash-reports".

Thank you for reporting bugs!

### Contributing
Beware of ugly code.

Bugfixes are generally welcome. If you want to contribute something which changes game mechanics, please talk to someone 
with commit privileges first. Nothing is more frustrating than putting a lot of work and effort into a new game mechanic 
and then having the PR rejected because it doesn't fit gameplay-wise.

### For Mod Developers
The Maven repository is not available yet. Use CurseForge or Modrinth's artifacts.
